# Collatz-conjecture
This is the Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n+1 conjecture. It is a mathematical conjecture that states that for any positive integer n, the following process will eventually reach the number 1:

If n is even, divide it by 2
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
The program you have written implements this conjecture. It takes a number as input and applies the steps above until the number reaches 1. It then prints each intermediate step along the way. For example, if the input is 6, the program will print the following sequence of numbers:

6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

The Collatz Conjecture has not been proven, but it has been tested extensively for many numbers and no counterexamples have been found.
